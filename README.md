# Advanced Regression Analysis

Course website for POL 683, Fall 2024

The purpose of this course is to introduce students to advanced regression techniques. Students in this course should be very familiar with linear regression, as well as the Gauss-Markov assumptions underlying the classical linear model (i.e., POL 682). In this course, we will consider a variety of regression techniques for categorical and limited data.
